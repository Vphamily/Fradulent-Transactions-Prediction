This Fraud Detection Server is designed to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time by analyzing transaction data through a machine learning model and providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model predictions.

The frontend is built with React, utilizing Material-UI components for a responsive, intuitive design. The backend leverages Python, specifically using libraries like Scikit-learn for building and training a machine learning model capable of identifying potentially fraudulent activities.

Here's why:
* Efficiency: Quickly processes transactions to determine fraud likelihood, enhancing security measures.
* Accessibility: Easy-to-use interface ensures that users can efficiently manage and review transactions.
* Backend architecture supports scaling to accommodate increased data loads without degradation in performance.
Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

  cd fraud_detection_server
  pip install openpyxl pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn Flask matplotlib
  python data.py
  puthon app.py

  cd payfraudapp 
  npm init
  npm install axios react @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
  npm start

  ```
